# run-isolated.sh — TEST ISOLATION for the shared single-worker emulator.
#
# The suite runs workers:1 against ONE shared emulator seed (run1), so specs can pollute each other's
# state (a check-in toggled off, a malformed pairing seeded by a variation spec, a token moved) — which
# makes full-suite results non-monotonic and is the root cause of "fixing one spec breaks another".
#
# This script removes that coupling WITHOUT touching any spec: it runs each spec FILE as its OWN
# Playwright invocation. Each invocation's globalSetup (queue/support/emulator-global-setup.ts) does a
# teardown+reseed of run1, so every file starts from a clean, identical seed and cannot be polluted by a
# file that ran before it. It reuses an already-running emulator + emulator-wired app (EMU_REUSE /
# EMU_REUSE_APP), so per file it is just "reseed + run that file" (no recompile).
#
# RESILIENCE (emulator target only — the functions-emulator crash, see specs/journals/2026-06-08-*): the
# functions emulator (port 5001) can die under a long run — 5001 stops listening while firestore(8080)/
# auth(9099) stay up and orphaned `functionsEmulatorRuntime` children linger. deploy-cf-emulator.sh now caps
# that at the source (SEQUENTIAL worker mode + heap ceiling), but REGARDLESS this runner self-heals: before
# each spec file it health-checks the emulator and, if unhealthy, reaps orphans + restarts it via
# deploy-cf-emulator.sh (with Homebrew openjdk on PATH so the Firestore/Auth JRE is found), waits for
# "All emulators ready", then continues. If the emulator dies DURING a file, that file is retried once on a
# fresh emulator so an infra crash is not miscounted as a test failure. The app on :4200 is owned by
# Playwright's webServer (reuseExistingServer) — started/reused per invocation — so this runner only manages
# the emulator. (None of this applies to TARGET=cloud, which has no local emulator.)
#
# SERIAL-ONLY (footgun fix): two copies of this script CANNOT run at once — they would both reseed the same
# run1 and tear down each other's seed (and fight over the single emulator on fixed ports). An atomic
# machine-wide lock (LOCK_DIR below) enforces this; a second invocation aborts with a clear message. A stale
# lock left by a dead PID is reclaimed automatically.
#
# Bonus: because each invocation is short, it also dodges the long-run reaping that kills a single 30-min
# full run. Used both locally and by .github/workflows/queue-e2e.yml. Exit code = number of spec files
# that had >=1 failing test (0 = whole suite green), so it works as a CI gate. (Exit 3 = could not acquire
# the serial lock; exit 4 = could not bring the emulator up.)
#
# Usage (emulator + app already up — `npm run emu:up` and `npm run start:emulator`):
#   EMU_REUSE=1 EMU_REUSE_APP=1 bash scripts/run-isolated.sh
#   ONLY='queue/studio-core.spec.ts queue/studio-session.spec.ts' bash scripts/run-isolated.sh   # subset
#   TARGET=cloud EVIDENCE=1 bash scripts/run-isolated.sh          # disposable cloud project + screenshots
#
# Two paths × three evidence levels (the npm scripts wrap these):
#   PATH:  TARGET=emulator (quick, hermetic)  |  TARGET=cloud (actual Firestore + CFs — the "proof" path)
#   LEVEL: A lean      EVIDENCE=0             screenshot only-on-failure, no merged report  → test:emu / test:cloud
#          B receipts  EVIDENCE=1 (DEFAULT)   screenshot EVERY test + on-first-retry trace  → report:emulator / report:cloud
#          C full      EVIDENCE=1 TRACE=full  screenshot EVERY test + FULL trace per test    → report:*:full
#   (B is the default report level — a shot per test, no per-action trace tax; C adds full traces: slower + large.)
# Env knobs (resilience, emulator target only):
#   EMU_AUTORESTART=0   disable the health-check/restart (fail fast if the emulator is down).
#   EMU_READY_TIMEOUT   seconds to wait for a restarted emulator to report ready (default 200).
#   FILE_RETRY=0        do not retry a file even if the emulator crashed during it.
